# Arrays

Arrays are a common question type used when you need scaled responses to a series of subquestions. The most common example is the 'How much do you agree with the following statements?' type. Responses are usually placed on a [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale).

{% capture text %}**A note on codes**
---
Have you noticed a pattern in the codes recommended here?  Questions have whole codes – subquestions have incrementing numerals added to the question code, answer options have incrementing alpha characters added to the question code.  This is not a hard and fast rule (you can use whatever codes you like), but it is a consistent standard which links answers with the question when collected data is viewed for analysis.{% endcapture %}
