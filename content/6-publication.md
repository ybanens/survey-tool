# Publication

Now it's time to publish your survey! First, we're going to look at how to reorder your questions, in case you added new ones or reconsidered the order while you were creating your survey. 

##Reordering Question Groups and Questions

{% capture text %}
1.	In the `Survey explorer` panel on the left-hand side of the screen, click on the `Question Organizer` button.
2.	Point the mouse to the top of the `Consent` question group to display a four-headed arrow mouse cursor.  Click and drag the question group to the top of the Survey so that it will appear first.
3.	Click the `Save and Close` button.
4.	Preview the survey. Remember the `Quota` will not apply until the survey is upgraded to Production and activated.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Survey properties – End message, End URL and URL description" text=text %}

##Upgrade to Production

{% capture text %}**Note:** Surveys can be created in `Production` if you already have an **Ethics Clearance Code**, but it is preferable to build them in `Sandpit` and then upgrade them (which you can do yourself).  Once the survey is upgraded to `Production`, the `Activate this survey` button will be shown on the toolbar.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color="info" %}

{% capture text %}
1.	In a browser, go to the `Research Survey Centre` website.
1.	Click on the `Register or Upgrade` link in the navigation panel.
2.	Click on `Upgrade Sandpit Survey`.
3.	Log in with your normal Griffith “s” number and password, then click the `Log in` button.
4.	Choose the survey to be upgraded.
5.	Fill in the additional fields paying particular attention to the required fields marked with *.
6.	Click the `Upgrade to Production` button.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Upgrade to Production" text=text %}

7.	In the “thank you for registering” screen, click on the red link to access the survey.

8.	Now you can edit the survey’s `General Settings & Texts` to remove the **(S)** from the survey’s title.
9.	Click the `Save and close` button.

{% capture text %}**A note on active surveys**
When a survey is deactivated, all related data tables (responses, participants, etc.) are automatically archived and will be inaccessible to you.  While the data can be retrieved by the technical team, it is best to leave the survey active until you have completely finished with exporting the data, analysing, etc., and won’t need to go back to it. To block any further responses after you have exported and begun analysing the data, you should set an expiry date.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color="warning" %}

## Set an expiry date

{% capture text %}
1.	Click the `Survey` button at the top of the `Survey explorer` to return to the `Survey Quick Actions` screen.   
2.	Click the `Survey properties` button on the toolbar.
3.	Click on `General settings and texts`.
4.	In the `Survey settings panel` click the `Publication & access control` heading.
5.	Click into the `Start date/time` text box or use the date picker to choose a start date.
6.	Click into the `Expiry date/time` text box or use the date picker to choose an expiry date.
7.	Click the `Save and close` button.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Set an expiry date" text=text %}

## Activating a survey

{% capture text %}
1.	In the `Survey quick actions` window click the `Activate this survey` button.

3.	Make any changes if necessary, then click `Save and activate survey`.
4.	Click `No thanks` to retain Open-access mode.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Activating a survey" text=text %}

{% include alert.md text=text color="info" %}
