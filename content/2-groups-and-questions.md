## Create a question group

Each survey must have at least one `Question group`, but it is useful to categorise each set of questions into different `Question groups` so that respondents understand the focus of any set of questions (refer to the survey design).

 
{% capture text %}
1.	Click on the large `Add Group` button on the screen.
2.	In the `Title:` text box, type **Activity and Movement**.  (Refer to the survey design)
3.	In the `Description:` text box, type (or copy and `Paste as Plain Text`):

**You are about to be asked about your day to day activity levels. This section is broken down into two main types of activities: vigorous-intensity sports and moderate-intensity sports.
When answering, please think about a typical week when you would be at school, university or at work. If you do not work and are not in education, please think about the activities you do during the equivalent hours of the day.**

4.	Click the `Save and close button`.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Question Group 1" text=text %}


## Navigation panel

{% capture text %}The panel on the left of the screen is the Navigation panel.  Now that you have created a Question group, the Question explorer section has opened and displays the new Question group.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color=info %}

## Create a question

{% capture text %}
1.	Click the large `Add new question to group` button on the screen. (You could alternatively click the `plus` symbol beside the `Question group` name in the `Question explorer`.)
2.	In the `Code:` text box, type **VI1**. (Vigorous Intensity 1 – refer to the survey design)
3.	In the `Question:` text box, type (or copy and `Paste as Plain Text`):

**Vigorous intensity sports
How many days in a typical week do you do vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activity?
Please answer in number of days**

4.	Bold the heading **Vigorous intensity sports**.
5.	In the `Help:` text box, type (or copy and `Paste as Plain Text`):

**Vigorous-intensity sports include running or football; are likely to cause large increases in breathing or heart rate and should be done for at least 10 minutes continuously.**

6.	Select and italicise the `Help:` text.{% endcapture %}
{% include card.md header="Question 1" text=text %}

 
### Question settings panel

The `Question settings panel` is the panel on the right-hand side of the `Question` screen.  As before, clicking on any left-facing arrowhead will expand the `Question settings``, while clicking on each heading will display the options.
