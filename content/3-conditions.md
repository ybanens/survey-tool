## Conditions

{% capture text %}If statements have the syntax “if…then”, however LimeSurvey Conditions meet the statement “Only show this question if…”  In simple terms, a LimeSurvey Condition is the “then” part of the If statement, so it is applied to the second (conditional) question.
In this example, we are saying “ask how many hours (VI2) only if the answer to VI1 is 1 or more”.{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.md text=text color=info %}
